<h2> Breeding </h2>

<p>
For the most part, penguins breed in large colonies that range in size from as few as 100 pairs to several hundred thousand pairs. Living in these large colonies has lead to high level social interaction between birds, which led to a large variety in penguins visually, and vocally.
Penguins form  monogomas pairs for a breeding season, with a high varience in pair recoupling. All penguins share incubation duties, which are generally shifts that can last for days, and even weeks as one member of the pair feeds. outside of the "little penguin" which lays 2-3 broods, penguins generally only have one brood.
</p>

<h2> Eggs </h2>

<p>
  Penguin eggs have the smallest ratio of egg weight to parent weight. The thick shell of a penguin's egg generally makes up 10-16% of the weight overall. The yolk is large as well, and makes up 22-31% of the egg. When a emporer penguin mother loses a chick, they will sometimes attempt to steal one from another mother.

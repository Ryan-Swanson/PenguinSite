   Penguins are a group of aquatic birds. They live almost exclusively in the southern hemisphere of Earth, with the exception of one species, the Galapagos penguin found in the northern hemisphere. They are adapted for life in the water, and have countershading(a method of camouflage where an animals coloration is darker on the upper side, and lighter on the lowerside), and are equipt with flippers for swimming. Contrary to popular thought, almost all species of penguins live outside of polar regions, and even a few live in the temperate(middle latitude) zones of the Earth.

   The word <em>penguin</em> first showed up as a synonym for great auk, which was a bird that had a similar appearance to modern day penguins, though they are not closely related. The precise etymology of the word however has not been decided. The English word <q>penguin</q> is not of French, Breton, or Spanish origin, although the Spanish, and Breton word for penguin are attributed to the French <q>pingouin.</q>
